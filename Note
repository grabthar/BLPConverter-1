Personal Notes:

*** PNG -> BLP ***
- P8 -> uncompressed, 0 bit alpha
- P8 with transparency -> uncompressed, 8bit alpha  (Note: Don't know how to make PNGs of this type, except for transparency count = 1)
- RGB -> compressed, DXT1
- RGBA	-> compressed, DXT3
	*OR*
		-> P8 with transparency [Use this option to preserve BLP format ]

*** BLP -> PNG ***
- uncompressed, 0 bit alpha -> P8
	Ex. Character Skins.
- uncompressed, 1 bit alpha -> P8 with alpha palette (1 entry)
	Ex. Some clothing (Deckhand's shirt for example)
- uncompressed, 8 bit alpha -> P8 with alpha palette (1 entry) [This is what WowImage does: retains palette, destroys alpha detail.]
	*OR*
							-> RGBA [Destroys palette, retains alpha detail.]
	Ex. Most clothing.  Item\TextureComponents\TorsoUpperTexture\Cloth_Horde_C_01Purple_Chest_TU_U.png for example.

  - compressed, 0 bit alpha -> DXT1
	Ex. Sansam root
- compressed, 1 bit alpha -> DXT1
	Ex. peaceflower
- compressed, 8 bit alpha -> DXT3
	Ex. sungrass


uncomp 1-bit:
- Deckhand's shirt (Cloth_A_03Crewman_Chest_TU_F.blp).  WowImage doesn't give an error when trying to decode this blp
but doesn't create a png, either.

Notes:
09-12-24: Added support for BLP_PAL_A4.
08-02-10: Removed SQUISH_USE_SSE=2 predefine from squish project.
